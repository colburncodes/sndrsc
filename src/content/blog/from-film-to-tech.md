Dear Past Colburn,

I'm writing this from the other side of a journey you're about to begin. You don't know it yet, but that programming elective you're considering will change everything. Those early days of tinkering with AOL, customizing MySpace layouts, and playing with HTML? They weren't just hobbies – they were glimpses of your future.

## The Crossroads

When your film school announces it's shutting down, it's going to feel like the world is crumbling. With a six-year-old daughter depending on you and only the GI Bill from your Navy service to fall back on, the pressure will be immense. But here's what you need to know: this moment isn't an ending – it's your beginning.

That tech workforce program in St. Louis? Take it. It's going to be your gateway. Two months of intense learning, and a week later, you'll land your first .NET job with the government. Yes, there will be tough times – living in Airbnbs, relying on unemployment support – but hold on. It gets better.

## The TripleTen Chapter

Later, you'll join TripleTen's bootcamp to deepen your JavaScript knowledge. The flexible structure will be a lifesaver – those late nights coding after putting the girls to bed will pay off. The externship program will push your boundaries, letting you lead projects and explore new technologies. And that career acceleration program? It's worth every penny. Those bi-weekly mock interviews will build the confidence you didn't know you needed.

Your career coach will ask you important questions: "Why would they want Colburn on their team?" She'll help you find your voice, teach you to connect with companies, and show you how to stand out. Listen to her – she knows what she's talking about.

## The Transformation

Today, I'm writing this as a Senior Software Engineer at New Balance. Remember that "starving artist" future you feared? Instead, you’ve gone after everything you ever wanted and more – leading engineering teams and mentoring others on their journey. You’ve created the life you imagined: a beautiful home filled with laughter, the freedom to travel and explore new passions, and most importantly, the ability to show your daughters that dreams aren’t just wishes – they’re blueprints for the future.

But the best part? You feel more like yourself than ever. You've found a community, built meaningful connections, and discovered that your creative background isn't a liability – it's your superpower.

## What I Wish You Knew

1. Stay focused on your local tech community – that's where your real opportunities will come from
2. Trust your instincts about what feels right for you, not what's trending
3. Those roadblocks? They're building your resilience
4. Your background in storytelling will make you a better engineer than you can imagine

Remember, you don't have to follow anyone else's path. The tech industry needs your unique perspective, your creativity, and your determination.

You're almost there. Keep pushing, keep learning, and keep believing in yourself. The journey ahead is more rewarding than you can imagine.

With pride and gratitude,
Present Colburn

P.S. Those late nights of coding while the kids sleep? They're worth every tired morning.
